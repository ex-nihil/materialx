# Parser for MaterialX (`.mtlx`) Files

This Rust library provides a parser for [MaterialX](https://materialx.org) files.
It is part of a project to provide MaterialX support for the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine.

## Current Status

Basic parsing works,
not all node types are implemented yet.
The structure of parsed data is subject to change.
